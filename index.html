            <h2 id="h2title">Welcome to a showcase of my cat Aspen through the past 4 years!</h2>
            <p id="p1">Aspen has always been a little rascal, she loves climbing up the walls and eating human food! Shes so cute we let her get away with it.
                But I was left no choice, someone had to make a website to show the world she's actually kind of stupid! So I'll show you the silly stupid 
                pictures of her and talk about what kind of year we had! Enjoy!!
            </p>
            <p id="pmain">This image is Aspen in 2020 after she underwent a skull transplant... JUST KIDDING! This silly cat let me take a picture of her, huge mistake
                since I immediatly made her head a triangle. 2020 was a tough year for me, I had lost a family member and moved away from home. Aspen was always there to
                cheer me up, even if it meant becoming a triangle. Her best quality is that she never lets me be lonely, she loves to cuddle and play so there's never a dull moment!
